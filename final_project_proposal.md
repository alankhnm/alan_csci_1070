1. I will be working alone on my Dataset.
2. I'm going to use Bike sharing dataset. This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.
3. Null Hypothesis: For the bike-sharing dataset, there will be no significant difference in bike rental demand across different times, weather conditions, or locations.
Alternative Hypothesis: For the bike-sharing dataset, there will be a significant difference in bike rental demand based on time of day, weather conditions, or specific locations.
4. I'm thinking of using multivariate linear model first for predicting trip duration or demand based on features like time, weather, and location. Or groupibng the demand to make it a knn problem.
